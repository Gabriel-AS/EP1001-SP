            In the previous segment, we went through the process for taking Gcode, and sending it through<br>
            to produce the final circuit boards. This section will discuss the process for Generating that<br>
            Gcode. So far the best option for designing a PCB layout is Autodesk Eagle, it is surprisingly<br>
            versatile, and allows you to import Libraries made by other people, which can help with specific<br>
            component footprints. The only downside is that there is a learning curve about as steep as a<br>
            brick wall, so it might help to play around with it, even I am still not used to it.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>Autodesk Eagle</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            First, Install autodesk Eagle, and hope that your wifi is strong enough, because this one will<br>
            take some time. After that is done, open and start Eagle, you'll be met with this menu.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert Menu here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-14.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Next, select file, new, project.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert directory here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-18.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And it brings you to the projects tab. From here you can select your libraries and projects to work on.<br>
            Right Click on your project, and select New Schematic.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert before schem here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-23.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And this brings you to the schematic, from her select Edit, Add.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert add direct here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-31.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This is where you can add various components. For this I will use a Library from the FabLab, as its got the SMD<br>
            components that are available to us.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert add here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-34.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            For demonstration on how to use this software, I will make a circuit that does absolutely nothing<br>
            just to keep things simple. If we take this capacitor, it shows us the circuit symbol, but more importantly<br>
            it shows us the Package footprint, which is great for figuring out which specific components to use.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert cap1 here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-38.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Alternatively, we have this capacitor with a much smaller footprint, lets use this one. Right click to rotate the component.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert cap2 here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-42.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Hit okay and drop as many as you'd like into the schematic. To make things easier, there is a button<br>
            under the save icon. This is to toggle a Grid, so select the grid size, and hit Display On, and Ok.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert grid here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-48.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This grid is surprisingly useful when it comes to alignment. Now if you zoom in you will notice there is a tiny<br>
            red cross on the component symbol, if you click and hold that red cross, you can move the component around, its<br>
            easy to spot here but for some of the larger ICs its almost impossible to find unless your brightness is at 100.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom in here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-52.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            If you click the the component to select it, it will appear 1 percent more Red than the others. Alternatively<br>
            you can Ctrl+A to select all, or even highlight it with the mouse. Its at this point you should know, working this<br>
            with a Laptop is just incredibly frustrating, much like every other Autodesk softwares.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom red here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-22.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the Left edge, theres a tool highlighted with a Green L icon, that is your routing, <br>
            to match component connections, where you can add circuit pathways.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom route here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-27.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now let's throw some other stuff in. You'll notice that LEDs have a very similar package footprint to Capacitors<br>
            or resistors, so it is very important to Label your components, which will make the next few steps less frustrating.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert menu again here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-31.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And for Ground connections and VCC you can search it in the search bar.
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert gnd and vcc here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-34.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert gnd and vcc here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-38.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            So we have this basic layout, you can highlight whole circuits over and Ctrl+C Ctrl+V, <br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert basic here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-52.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now here is a neat trick for complex circuits, if you extend a small route and Label it, something like B1<br>
            and label another connection as B1 as well like this. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert label here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-58.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            You will be prompted with this that asks to Connect the two points, Click Ok.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-02.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            So that leaves us with this layout. On the top there is a button highlighted, that will switch over to the Board layout.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert boarder here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-05.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And this is the main board layout. First thing, do not Ctrl+A here as it will also select and move the Origin positon.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-11.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Once again, set up a grid layout to make things easier to align,<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-14.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            You can highlight and move all of the components. Those yellow lines between the components are the<br>
            circuit connections, otherwise known as a Ratsnest for..obvious reasons. First we have to Untangle<br>
            that, and this is exactly why Labelling matters here, Because every component here looks the same.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-18.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now that we have this untangled, by physically moving and rotating components around, you notice that<br>
            C6 and C3 are connected, as are C4 and C1, even though they were not connected in the schematic.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-22.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Next, try to move the entire pattern as close to the Bottom left corner of the work area, that bottom<br>
            corner is the origin. There is a tool highlighted, Route Airwire, select and use that to draw the Actual<br>
            circuit connections.
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-29.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            That is done for now, the tool highlighted in this one can select how the Routes deal with corners.<br>
            the default setting locks the corners to 45 degree angles because apparently Lithography does not cope<br>
            well with 90 degree corners. As for our method of production, a CNC router has no trouble with those<br>
            90 degree corners. 
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-36.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            So now we are ready to capture the artwork, so go under Layers.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-39.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Select all layers, hide them, and unhide only the Top layer, this will show only the connections and pads.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-47.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Also don't forget to Resize the work area so your captured image later is not massive.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-51.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            now with only the Top layer on, select Export, Image,<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert connect here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-10-54.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Name it, set the resolution up to about 1000, Monochrome, and hit Ok<br>
            </kbd></p>
