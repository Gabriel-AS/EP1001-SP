            In the previous segment, we went through the process for taking Gcode, and sending it through<br>
            to produce the final circuit boards. This section will discuss the process for Generating that<br>
            Gcode. So far the best option for designing a PCB layout is Autodesk Eagle, it is surprisingly<br>
            versatile, and allows you to import Libraries made by other people, which can help with specific<br>
            component footprints. The only downside is that there is a learning curve about as steep as a<br>
            brick wall, so it might help to play around with it, even I am still not used to it.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>Autodesk Eagle</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            First, Install autodesk Eagle, and hope that your wifi is strong enough, because this one will<br>
            take some time. After that is done, open and start Eagle, you'll be met with this menu.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert Menu here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-14.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Next, select file, new, project.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert directory here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-18.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And it brings you to the projects tab. From here you can select your libraries and projects to work on.<br>
            Right Click on your project, and select New Schematic.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert before schem here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-23.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And this brings you to the schematic, from her select Edit, Add.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert add direct here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-31.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This is where you can add various components. For this I will use a Library from the FabLab, as its got the SMD<br>
            components that are available to us.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert add here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-34.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            For demonstration on how to use this software, I will make a circuit that does absolutely nothing<br>
            just to keep things simple. If we take this capacitor, it shows us the circuit symbol, but more importantly<br>
            it shows us the Package footprint, which is great for figuring out which specific components to use.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert cap1 here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-38.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Alternatively, we have this capacitor with a much smaller footprint, lets use this one. Right click to rotate the component.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert cap2 here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-42.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Hit okay and drop as many as you'd like into the schematic. To make things easier, there is a button<br>
            under the save icon. This is to toggle a Grid, so select the grid size, and hit Display On, and Ok.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert grid here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-48.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This grid is surprisingly useful when it comes to alignment. Now if you zoom in you will notice there is a tiny<br>
            red cross on the component symbol, if you click and hold that red cross, you can move the component around, its<br>
            easy to spot here but for some of the larger ICs its almost impossible to find unless your brightness is at 100.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom in here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-08-52.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            If you click the the component to select it, it will appear 1 percent more Red than the others. Alternatively<br>
            you can Ctrl+A to select all, or even highlight it with the mouse. Its at this point you should know, working this<br>
            with a Laptop is just incredibly frustrating, much like every other Autodesk softwares.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom red here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-22.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the Left edge, theres a tool highlighted with a Green L icon, that is your routing, <br>
            to match component connections, where you can add circuit pathways.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert zoom route here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-08_15-09-27.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now let's throw some other stuff in. You'll notice that LEDs have a very similar package footprint to Capacitors<br>
            or resistors, so it is very important to Label your components, which will make the next few steps less frustrating.<br>
            </kbd></p>
