             For the final project, I am going to build a better LED Nixie display. This is again, going to be heavily<br>
             influenced by the Cronixie project, and instead of a full clock display, I will just construct<br>
             one display, that can display the digits from 0 to 9, and can be controlled by a scroll wheel.<br>

            <strong>List of Materials needed:</strong><br>
            20 WS2812B LEDs<br>
            1 Micro USB Female Port<br>
            1 100nF SMD Capacitor<br>
            1 49.9Ohm SMD Resistor<br>
            2 ISP headers<br>
            1 Attiny85 IC<br>
            2 Copper PCB Blanks
            <kbd></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            The main improvement, will be if I can shrink the entire circuit up there, to a single copper blank,<br>
            which leaves me about 75x50mm of space to lay All that. The way I hope to do this, is by fitting the<br>
            Attiny85 onto the same board as the LEDS. On top of that, that one board will also have the ISP header<br>
            and two seperate power supplies, one for the LEDS and another for the Attiny85. Not to mention the 20<br>
            LEDs. I throught of doing a 7 Segment variant, which will be alot simpler, but I am not sure if the Parallax<br>
            offset from one plate to the next would make it look weird.</kbd></p>

            The circut should not be too difficult, Like last time it only needs 2 I/O pins, one for the LED data line,<br>
            and the other running an analogread for the scroll wheel. I'll also be using the WS2812 Neopixel LED, if I<br>
            cannot get it in a raw package, I might just get a bunch of them premade on a 3x3 matrix board, like last time,<br>
            but instead I will just desolder them from the board and solder them onto my circuit board.<br>

      <p><kbd>
            Before that, I designed a circuit schematic on eagle, and uses the footprint of the WS2812 LED, which I got<br>
            from this github page above.<br>
            <kbd></p>

            </p>
          
      <p><kbd>
            I ended up chaining the 20 LEDs together first, Dout into Din, to form this massive 20 LED strip, so in theory,<br>
            LEDs 0 and 19 will control number 0, and LEDs 9 and 10 control number 9.<br>
            And here is the schematic with all the other stuff in it. I plan to run this off 2 power supplies, A barrel jack<br>
            sending a steady 5V to the LEDs, and a Micro USB sending 5V to the Attiny85.<br>
            <kbd></p>

            On some schematics it shows a capacitor between the Power and Ground pins on each LED, so I added it into the design<br>
            <kbd></p>
          <p>

            </p>
              
            <p><kbd>
            But I then realised it was gonna be a nightmare to untangle in the Board arrangement, so I decided to add a single large<br>
            capacitor between the 5V and ground pins of the LED chain. Here is the final Ratsnest, which just barely fits on a single<br>
            copper blank.

            I have a feeling it will struggle to cut properly around the IC chip, so I might set it to cut on just 1 pass.<br>
            The 6 pin header pads are just there to help with soldering on Non Surface Mount components.<br>
            The pad right at the top and the second one from the bottom, those will be a common ground for both power supplies.<br>
            There will be a floating Barrel jack port which connects to the bottom 2 pads by wire, the lowest pad being the 5V.<br>
            The top 3 pads will be connected to a floating Variable Resistor by wire, which will serve as a scroll wheel for input.<br>
            The middle 2nd pad from the top is connected to the analog input on the Attiny85, while the pad just below it is connected<br>
            to the Barrel Jack power supply. This is only a first draft, this is just to help me get a rough understanding of How the<br>
            LED arrangement should look like, and how much space do I have left to work with.<br>
