             For the final project, I am going to build a better LED Nixie display. This is again, going to be heavily<br>
             influenced by the Cronixie project, and instead of a full clock display, I will just construct<br>
             one display, that can display the digits from 0 to 9, and can be controlled by a scroll wheel.<br>

            The main improvement, will be if I can shrink the entire circuit up there, to a single copper blank,<br>
            which leaves me about 75x50mm of space to lay All that. The way I hope to do this, is by fitting the<br>
            Attiny85 onto the same board as the LEDS. On top of that, that one board will also have the ISP header<br>
            and two seperate power supplies, one for the LEDS and another for the Attiny85. Not to mention the 20<br>
            LEDs. I throught of doing a 7 Segment variant, which will be alot simpler, but I am not sure if the Parallax<br>
            offset from one plate to the next would make it look weird.</kbd></p>

            The circut should not be too difficult, Like last time it only needs 2 I/O pins, one for the LED data line,<br>
            and the other running an analogread for the scroll wheel. I'll also be using the WS2812 Neopixel LED, if I<br>
            cannot get it in a raw package, I might just get a bunch of them premade on a 3x3 matrix board, like last time,<br>
            but instead I will just desolder them from the board and solder them onto my circuit board.<br>

            Before that, I designed a circuit schematic on eagle, and uses the footprint of the WS2812 LED, which I got<br>
            from this github page above.<br>

            I ended up chaining the 20 LEDs together first, Dout into Din, to form this massive 20 LED strip, so in theory,<br>
            LEDs 0 and 19 will control number 0, and LEDs 9 and 10 control number 9.<br>
