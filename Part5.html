        <h3><kbd>GCode from Fusion 360</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Once again we will be using Fusion 360 to generate the Gcode, this time for the Stepcraft.<br>
            The same machine that made the PCBs earlier, can also be used to create foam Bucks for resin<br>
            casting. First we will need a model, this one is of a Nut, which I intend to use as a scroll knob<br>
            for the final project. The only thing to take note is that the Smallest gaps in the model, in this<br>
            case between the edge of the nut and the mould wall, that gap has to be Larger than the mill bit, which<br>
            in this case is a 3mm flat endmill bit.
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            The first step, much like in 2D CNC, is to create a set up and select your boxpoint. This time the boxpoint<br>
            is in the center of the model. Once that is done, under 3D, select adaptive clearing, and select your Tool bit,<br>
            a 3mm flat endmill, and No coolant. The feed rate and the chipload in this case can be higher, as a large end mill<br>
            cutting Foam, is like a hot knife through butter. So you can stay around 1200mm/min.
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            For the next section, all you have to do is select the contours to mill. In this case I split the toolpath to 2 sections.<br>
            the first is to bore out the hole in the middle, and the next would be to start milling the outer edges of the mould. <br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-01-29_18-34-25.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            The third section, the default settings will work, just ensure that the Bottom height is set to 0. This will ensure that<br>
            the CNC does not cut clean Through the material, unlike in 2D CNC. The end result of this foam cut is to pour Silicone<br>
            moulding compound into it, so it has to be watertight at least.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-01-29_18-34-18.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            The fourth section, you can leave bring the Roughing stepdown much further as compared to the 2D CNC or PCBs, so in this case<br>
            it pushes the bit down by 6mm on each level, which allows it to cut through more material in less time. A general guide would<br>
            be to have the stepdown be the same as the tool diameter, 3mm, but because we are cutting foam, we can be abit more aggresive.<br>
            As for the Fine stepdown, that is the finishing cut, so have it to 1/10th of the tool diameter, in this case its 0.3mm<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-01-29_18-34-39.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the last section, you can leave most of it to the default settings, and hit OK, and wait for abit while it processes.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-01-29_18-34-32.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Once that is done, repeat the same process for Another adaptive clearing, in this case its for the outer sections of the nut,<br>
            as seen here.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And finally, select your post processing from the top of the workflow. Use STEPCRAFT UCCNC/stepcraft uccnc as your post processor.<br>
            And select the output folder to be somewhere you can find, like your desktop. And now we can move on to the Actual foam cutting.
            </kbd></p>

            The general set up process is the same as on PCB production, the only difference is that you can be a little less precise in your<br>
            calibration. I did not even bother using the Calibrating cylinder in the back, I just brought the 3mm mill bit to what I estimated<br>
            to be the center of the foam piece, marked it with a sharpie and zeroed the x,y,z values.
            </kbd></p>

            And almost immediately you notice 2 things. 1, The finishing on foam is not nearly as neat, which means the finishing on the Resin mould<br>
            will have that same texture, but that actually helps me. I was going for that look of messy Cast Iron for the nut. 2, the dust that the<br>
            kicks up is truly something to behold. So be sure to wear a mask to not inhale any of the dust, and to have a vacuum cleaner on standby.<br>
