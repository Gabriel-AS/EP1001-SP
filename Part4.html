        <h3><kbd>GCode from Fusion 360</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            There are a few ways to generate Gcode for the massive 2D CNC down at FabLab, such as from Vcarve Pro.<br>
            I prefer working with Fusion 360 directly. For my CNC project, I want to construct a stand for a prop<br>
            rifle and a bayonet. This is the model I built in Fusion 360, as always, link to file on the homepage.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now make sure to lay the parts flat like this<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert flet photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-47-58.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            One important thing to do, is to keep all the material widths, and the slot sizes on parametric. This<br>
            makes it much easier to edit the model to account for inconsistencies in the material thickness.<br>
            Under modify, change parameters.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            You will arrive at this menu, notice that the material thickness I selected is 15mm, which is the typical<br>
            thickness on most of the scrap plywood sheets.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Also, because the CNC machine uses a rotary bit, it does not cope well with Right angle cuts. Which is why<br>
            we apply these cuts known as Dogbones into the right angle cuts. Without them, the Right angle cuts come out<br>
            with a small fillet because of the rotary bit. I am using a dogbone Add in I found on the Autodesk app store.<br>

        <p><kbd>
            Now on the top Left, switch the mode to Manufacture.
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            Under Setup, select New Setup.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-12.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        
        <p><kbd>
            You will arrive at this menu, and under Setup, make sure your operation type is Milling. Under Work<br>
            Coordinate System, follow those settings and make sure your XYZ marker is on one of your corners, with<br>
            the Z marker facing up. The idea being that Negative Z means cutting into the material. <br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-16.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the next tab, follow those perameters. You can even see just how much material you need. For this<br>
            project I estimate that it will take up about one quarter of the fresh stock.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab 2here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-18.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the last tab, you can select a job name, and hit OK.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-22.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now our first process would be to cut the slots out of the base, its easier to cut those out before cutting<br>
            the entire section out. Under 2D, select 2D contour, which allows for complete cuts through the material.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-29.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the first tab, under tool, click select and you will be brought to this menu. The tool in the FabLab is a 6mm<br>
            Flat End mill, running an upcut. Much like milling out the PCBs in the previous section, you have to take multiple<br>
            passes when cutting through the material, otherwise you risk sheering the mill bit off, which is quite terrifying.<br>
            This also means that the cut finish on Plywood is not as clean when cutting against the grain on the top layers.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-32.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now those are the parameters I am using for the cut. The main concern is the Feed Rate, in other words how fast the<br>
            mill bit is getting dragged through the material. On the PCB millbit we used something around 50mm/minute, this one<br>
            can take around 1500mm/min. I am not too confident with this feedrate so I might end up going into the text file and<br>
            changing the number to something a little slower. As for Coolant and Spindle Speed, the machine down at FabLab has the<br>
            spindle speed controlled externally, so your Gcode would not change anything, and it doesnt have active coolant either.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-34.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the next tab, select the lower profiles of the slots you want to cut. This tells the machine to cut to the Lower depth.<br>
            Also, select tabs as there will be a small piece of leftover wood in the middle of that slot cut, which might get flung<br>
            around and possibly damage the rest of the wood. I tend to keep the tabs at around 10mm by 2mm big, and select them by<br>
            distance. You can go in and manually place the tabs by changing the Tab Position setting. But on a model this big, I am<br>
            perfectly fine with hammering out many tabs. <br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-36.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            If you zoom in you can see roughly where the tab will be made. In some cases if you choose to set tabs by Distance and not<br>
            manually, it will assign tabs in random locations. But on closed profiles like that slot, it manages to keep the position fairly<br>
            symmetrical. 
            </kbd></p>
        
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-39.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On the third tab you can keep to the system defaults, all except for the bottom height which is offset by -1mm. This<br>
            ensures that the mill bit punches clean through the material, and makes the finish slightly better on the bottom surface.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-41.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now on to the fourth tab, you can keep to the same default settings, 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-43.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Select Multiple passes, choose your roughing stepdown to somewhere around 6mm, and you can leave finishing stepdowns to 0,<br>
            at the end the cut finish will still look quite rough, so you can select rough final. After all, sandpaper solves everything.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-46.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            On the last tab, you can keep to the default settings and hit OK.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-48.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Which leaves you with this cut profile where you can press simulate under actions, and check if it really is doing multiple passes.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p> 
            <img alt="-Insert tab here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-12-04_12-48-51.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now, repeat that exact same process for the rest of the cut, remember to select the lower profile, so it cuts to around<br>
            that depth. You can keep the exact same parameters, multiple passes at 6mm stepdown. The only difference being the tabs.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Notice that now fusion 360 decides to throw tabs in random places, which you can change around by increasing the<br>
            distance between each tab, or simply just setting each tab down manually. 
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Which leaves us with this final cut profile. You can move the order of the cut operations around, to ensure some cut operations<br>
            happen before others, again simulate to make sure the GCode is actually taking multiple passes, and doing what you need it to.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            Which brings you to this page, select Post Configuration, and choose Mach3mil for the FabLab CNC, which throws in all the necessary<br>
            additional code and indentations. Choose the file output location to somewhere easy to get to like your desktop, and hit Post.<br>

            And much like the PCB milling machine, this also has a Z calibrator. You can put it on another piece of wood when calibrating<br>
            if you want to run an Air Cut first.

        <p><kbd>
            The first thing we did was to run a sample cut, to see how well the machine handles 15mm plywood, with a pocket and a slot.<br>

            Overall, the end finish is not terrible, which you can fix with a penknife and some sandpaper. Notice how the burrs<br>
            and the splintering occurs more around the edges where the bit is running against the grain of the wood. It was great<br>
            fun carrying this thing home on the train and have little bits of debris fall off everytime I shook it around. But this<br>
            does serve as a good warning for when I cut out my rifle stand: bring an Ikea bag.
