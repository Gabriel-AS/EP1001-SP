            This will be a quick one. First, put on some gloves, but not the blue Nitrile ones. Apparently the moulding<br>
            compound reacts with it in a way I do not want to find out. Next, grab Alot of tissue paper, this will be<br>
            messy no matter how you do it. Now get these two bottles very kindly labelled A and B, a foam cup, and<br>
            something to stir with like an ice cream stick. 
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            On your foam buck, spray the surface with this, one quick pass with this will help release the silicone mould later on.<br>
            Just be sure to spray it facing down into a bin, to avoid fogging up the whole workshop.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-06.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now, pour the contents of bottle A and B into a foam cup, in a 1 to 1 proportion. Check it using a weighing scale. You should<br>
            not need much of it depending on what size is your mould. For my 50mm by 50mm by 18mm foam piece, I only ended up using 18g of A and<br>
            B each, and I still had quite abit leftover. Take your time to mix it, as you have about 45 minutes before the compound just fails. <br>
            Mix it gently until the Dark blue colour of B and the White colour of A even out to roughly this.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-31.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Next, pour the mixed compound into your Foam piece, start at a corner and just let it flow naturally until everything is sealed.<br>
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-01-54.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now gently put it into a Vacuum chamber as seen here, on a piece of tissue paper to prevent it from boiling and spilling everywhere incase<br>
            the pressure suddenly rises. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>

        <p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            First thing, make sure this cork is removed, 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-14.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Open the valve leading to the Vacuum pump, and close the valve leading to that black intake. Switch On the vacuum pump,<br>
            and leave it until the pressure goes to about that halfway mark.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-28.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            And then, close off both valves to hold the pressure there. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-25.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            You'll notice that your mould starts bubbling slightly, which means the vacuum pump is working and is removing any<br>
            air trapped under the surface. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-02-21.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            After that, put it somewhere flat and level, and then it is just a matter of leaving it to cure for about 6 hours, as stated on the box. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-01_13-01-54.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            A few days later the mould is hard and dry, easy way to test:
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-02-53.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now is just a matter of breaking the foam apart, there are no steps to this other than have a vacuum cleaner ready.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-02-46.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And now we have our silicone mould. It still has a decent amount of dust from the foam, so I cleaned it up with a brush.
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-03-01.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>

        <p><kbd>
            I ended up using this generic resin-hardener set, with not much documentation on it other than a 15 minute potlife.<br>
            The big one on the left is the resin, while the one on the right is the hardener. General mixing ratio of the resin<br>
            to the hardener is 3 to 1. I poured and mixed it in a foam cup, with a bit left over. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-03-27.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
                
        <p><kbd>
            Next I started up the vacuum chamber like earlier, and placed the resin mix in to de-gas. 
            </kbd></p>
 
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-03-24.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This time for some reason it vented a lot more gas, as seen here. These photos were taken about 2 minutes apart each.
            </kbd></p>

        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-04-25.jpg" height="500"/>

        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-04-21.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            All that bubbling vanishes the moment the pressure equalises, so once the foaming settles down, very carefully open the<br>
            release valve and let the pressure back into the vacuum chamber.
            </kbd></p>
        
         
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-03-05.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
        
        <p><kbd>
            And finally, pour the de-gassed mix into the silicone mould, gently setting it in with a scraper,
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-03-31.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
         <p><kbd>
            And leave that to cure for about 24 hours.
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert photo here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2021-02-08_12-04-33.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        
         <p><kbd>
            Its been a few days, and the finishing is abit rough, but this is perfect for what I intended to make, which when<br>
            painted over with a black base coat and drybrushed with silver, gives a decent cast-metal look.
            </kbd></p>
