        <p><kbd><strong>
            The first step is to get the toolchain on your computer. This will heavily reference the<br>
            instructions for building FabTinyISP, linked here:</kbd></p>
            
        <p><a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/index.html">FabTinyISP</a><br><p>
        
        <p><kbd><strong>
            Scroll down and you'll come to the instructions for Software installation. This is assuming<br>
            you have made the board, finished soldering it, and confident that the circuit is not about<br>
            to short out one of your USB ports. There are seperate instructions depending on your OS, windows<br>
            MacOS or even Linux. This will focus on windows, which happens to be the least straightforward.<br>
            </kbd></p>
            
        <p><kbd><strong>
            Programming your Programmer, requires a working programmer. Plug in the working programmer, and<br>
            open up your device manager, somewhere you should be able to see working programmer listed as USBtinySPI.<br>
            After that you can start downloading the toolchain from that link above.<br>
            I recommend not deviating from those instructions in any way, even where to Extract the files to. <br>
            One thing to note, there is a step that involves a program called Zadig, Disconnect all<br>
            other USB devices, and be very sure which device you are targetting. And if you are worried you might<br>
            mess it up, try this process on a laptop first, and not your expensive PC.

            I had no photos of this process, as I had been trying and failing over the course of the past 2 months,<br>
            and only recently managed to get it working. The most I have from it is the sanity check right at the end,<br>
            which is used to tell if all the programs in the toolchain are running right. That should run fine, if it<br>
            does show some errors like "command not found", best strategy is to read the documentation, and ask for help.<br>
            </kbd></p>
