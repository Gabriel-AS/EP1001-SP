        <p><kbd>
            Given that one of the problems with the last project was the fact that I had<br>
            to build the entire project around an LED board that someone else had designed.<br>
            This leads to the first topic, Making our own PCBs, so that we can work on Our<br>
            design parameters, without having to resort to questionable Hand-fitting methods.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            There are many ways we can produce our own PCBs, such as etching by Ferric Chloride,<br>
            or by film lithography. Those can produce some very high quality PCBs, but they come<br>
            with their own issues like waste chemical disposal, and more importantly, the Cost.<br>
            Which is why the method we will be using is by milling/machining. In short it involves<br>
            a CNC router with a very fine bit, cutting away a pattern from a thin sheet of copper,<br>
            which is laminated to a sheet of something non conductive like plastic, as seen here:<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            Easier said than done..
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            In order to operate the router, we need to upload a Gcode file, which is just a set of<br>
            Machine operation instructions, and several hundred coordinate instructions in relative XYZ.<br>
            The specific CNC device we have access to is a modified Stepcraft 420, as seen here:<br>
            </kbd></p>

            You'll notice a small silver cylinder on the back on a wire, that is the calibration device for<br>
            the miller. The device might require some calibration before running it, so here are the steps.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, go get a copper blank, which looks like this, and secure it to the bed of the miller.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert copper sheet-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-05-08_12-53-16.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now place the calibration device onto the copper blank, and manually guide the router head to the calibrator<br>
            using the arrow keys, press shift or slide the jog speed, to increase the speed of the router head, but be gentle.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Look to the computer next to it, and you'll see this UI,<br>
            </kbd></p>
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert UI-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-05-08_12-53-16.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            The highlighted button here will lower the drillbit onto the calibrator to re-zero the new Z height.<br>
            Press that button when you have the Gcode ready to run. It is recommended to do an aircut beforehand<br>
            to see if the miller is tracing out the approximate correct pathway. To do the aircut, manually set<br>
            the Z height to a zero slightly above the copper blank, and hit Run. As this is happening, that Grey<br>
            box below the diagram will show the Gcode command list, as well as the Number of the command it is on.<br>
            </kbd></p>
