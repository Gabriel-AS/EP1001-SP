        <p><kbd>
            Given that one of the problems with the last project was the fact that I had<br>
            to build the entire project around an LED board that someone else had designed.<br>
            This leads to the first topic, Making our own PCBs, so that we can work on Our<br>
            design parameters, without having to resort to questionable Hand-fitting methods.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            There are many ways we can produce our own PCBs, such as etching by Ferric Chloride,<br>
            or by film lithography. Those can produce some very high quality PCBs, but they come<br>
            with their own issues like waste chemical disposal, and more importantly, the Cost.<br>
            Which is why the method we will be using is by milling/machining. In short it involves<br>
            a CNC router with a very fine bit, cutting away a pattern from a thin sheet of copper,<br>
            which is laminated to a sheet of something non conductive like plastic, as seen here:<br>

            Easier said than done..
            </kbd></p>
        p><kbd>
            In order to operate the router, we need to upload a Gcode file, which is just a set of<br>
            Machine operation instructions, and several hundred coordinate instructions in relative XYZ.<br>
