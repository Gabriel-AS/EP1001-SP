        <h3><kbd>PCB Manufacturing</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Given that one of the problems with the last project was the fact that I had<br>
            to build the entire project around an LED board that someone else had designed.<br>
            This leads to the first topic, Making our own PCBs, so that we can work on Our<br>
            design parameters, without having to resort to questionable Hand-fitting methods.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            There are many ways we can produce our own PCBs, such as etching by Ferric Chloride,<br>
            or by film lithography. Those can produce some very high quality PCBs, but they come<br>
            with their own issues like waste chemical disposal, and more importantly, the Cost.<br>
            Which is why the method we will be using is by milling/machining. In short it involves<br>
            a CNC router with a very fine bit, cutting away a pattern from a thin sheet of copper,<br>
            which is laminated to a sheet of something non conductive like plastic, as seen here:<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Easier said than done.. first we need to generate a Gcode file, but we'll cover that later on.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            In order to operate the router, we need to upload our Gcode file, which is just a set of<br>
            Machine operation instructions, and several hundred coordinate instructions in relative XYZ.<br>
            The specific CNC device we have access to is a modified Stepcraft 420, as seen here:<br>
            </kbd></p>
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert stepcraft-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-05_10-45-49.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
         <p><kbd>
            You'll notice a small silver cylinder on the back on a wire, that is the calibration device for<br>
            the miller. The device might require some calibration before running it, so here are the steps.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert stepcraft-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-14_10-50-21.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, go get a copper blank, which looks like this, apply some double sided tape to the back, and paste<br>
            it onto one of the cutouts in the plywood bed. Be sure not to overlap any of the double sided tape, you<br>
            need to keep the copper blank as level as possible. For some added security, get some masking tape and <br>
            tape the sides of the copper blank down to the bed, to keep it from slipping off the plywood.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert copper sheet-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-05_10-45-43.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now grab a spanner to open the chuck of the mill head, there is a black oval button somwhere below the main Start<br>
            button, pressing that will lock the rotary head of the mill in place, allowing you to loosen the chuck on the mill.<br>
            Open it up, and slip in your mill bit. Now there are 2 main types, V bits, and straight End-mills. For cutting traces<br>
            I would recommend using a V bit as it is much more stable, and you can control the Width of the cut purely based on<br>
            the cut depth. Save the End-mills for cutting out the outline of your board. Both of them are equally sharp and fragile<br>
            so pay attention, and take your time when securing the bit into the chuck. Try not to overtighten the chuck, but also<br>
            try not to leave it too loose. The moment turning the spanner becomes significantly harder, that's the cue to stop.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            For context, these are V bits, most in the box will still be fairly sharp.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert vbitt-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-14_11-21-10.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
                <p><kbd>
            And these are End-mills, you'll notice that a few of them are not as long as the others, those were<br>
            probably broken off during milling, high torque and a very thin bit are not a good combination.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert endbitt-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-14_11-21-14.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now place the calibration device onto the copper blank, and manually guide the router head to the calibrator<br>
            using the arrow keys for x and y movement, page up and page down for z movement. Press shift to increase the<br>
            speed of the movement, but do not press shift too often or when the mill bit is anywhere near the bed. There<br>
            is a chance that the computer will sense and lock Sticky Keys while you're moving the millbit up and down, and<br>
            instead decide to crush the millbit into the workpiece you spent 40 minutes waiting for. Slow and Steady is key.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Look to the computer next to it, and you'll see this UI, to load in your Gcode, select Toolpath and Load file.<br>
            </kbd></p>
            <p>
            <img alt="-Insert UI-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-05_10-45-39.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            The highlighted button here will lower the drillbit onto the calibrator to re-zero the new Z height.<br>
            Press that button when you have the Gcode ready to run. It is recommended to do an aircut beforehand<br>
            to see if the miller is tracing out the approximate correct pathway. To do the aircut, manually set<br>
            the Z height to a zero slightly above the copper blank, and hit Cycle Start. As this is happening, that Grey<br>
            box below the diagram will show the Gcode command list, as well as the Number of the command it is on.<br>
            If you need to, you can re-zero the X and Y positons, to make sure the blank has enough room for your circuit.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p>
            <img alt="-Insert UI highlight-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1001-SP/photo_2020-11-05_10-45-36.jpg" height="500"/>
            </p>
        <p><kbd>
            Before you hit cycle start, do remember that the router is using a very fragile bit, which is subjected to a lot<br>
            of vibration and torque, and there is a very good chance of the bit breaking off and flying off in a dangerous<br>
            direction, such as the user's face. Wear safety googles, your mask might do a decent job of protecting the lower<br>
            half of your face, but I would not lean my face anywhere near that router head when it is active. Just let it run<br>
            for a few minutes, and once its done, there should be a vacuum cleaner nearby to get rid of all the debris.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now carefully remove the cirbuit board, its got some burrs on it which can be quite sharp, so take it to some<br>
            finegrit sandpaper to smooth it out. Just a few passes should do, the traces might be fragile, so slow and steady.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>Populating the board</kbd></h3>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Now comes the hard part, soldering all the components onto the board. Considering this sem focuses on SMD or<br>
            Surface Mount type components, majority of the components can as small as a grain of sand, so best not to lose<br>
            them. Put them on a brightly coloured mat, and keep it infront of you so you don't knock them onto the floor<br>
            with a bunch of other debris or plastic scraps that look just like your SMD components. Here are some of them:<br>
            </kbd></p>
